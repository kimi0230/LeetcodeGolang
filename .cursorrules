# Cursor Project Rules

## Project Context
This is a Golang project for Leetcode solutions and data structures.

## General Guidelines
- Always use idiomatic Go.
- Refer to `.cursor/rules/` for detailed sub-rules.
- Prioritize time and space complexity analysis in every code explanation.
- Keep the `Leetcode/` directory as the main source of problem solutions.

## File Organization
- `structures/`: Common data structures (Heap, TreeNode, ListNode, etc.)
- `Leetcode/`: Individual problem solutions.
- `template/`: Algorithmic templates (Segment Tree, Union Find, etc.)

## Custom Commands (Prompts)
- **UMPIRE**: Whenever you see "UMPIRE" or are asked to solve using UMPIRE, strictly follow the template in `.cursor/prompts/umpire.md`.
