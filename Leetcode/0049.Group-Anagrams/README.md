# [0049.Grop Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

## 題目
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]

Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
 

Constraints:

* 1 <= strs.length <= 104
* 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
* strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
