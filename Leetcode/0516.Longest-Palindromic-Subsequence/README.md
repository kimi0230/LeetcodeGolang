# [516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)

## 題目
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s consists only of lowercase English letters.

## 題目大意
給你一個字符串 s，找到 s 中最長的回文子串。
